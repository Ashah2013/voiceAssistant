  # Idea of Application
  I have built a virtual assistant, also called an AI assistant or digital assistant, that is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.

  # Programming Practices
   - Use of consistent indentation
   - Followed proper Naming Conventions
   - Very simple to use
   - Proper commenting and documentation
   - Scalable 
   - Proper error return values and exception handling conventions
   - Iterative waterfall model

  # Building stratgy
  The computer needs to be able to recognize our speech. 
This is where natural language processing comes in. This is a less complicated form of natural language processing. Basically, NLP is a form of AI that lets the computer take in and store information. Then, analyse that information and relay what it is programmed to do. 

  # Overview
  To personalise your computer at your ease to do daily chores and stuff that people do using their laptop or personal computer is automated using this python personal assistant ## PEPSA
  
  # Motivation
  A person who has never interacted with the Command Line Interface or even the UI interface can do daily usage stuff using python personal assistant
  
  ## Features 
  

  # Technical Aspect
  It is built on using two major modules-
  1. [gTTS]( https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)
  2. [speech_Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)<br/>
  along with<br/>
  - [Playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/)
  
  # Installation
  The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the assistant 
```bash
python voiceAssistance.py
```
